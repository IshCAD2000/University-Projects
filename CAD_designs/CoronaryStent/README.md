Hello! 

Welcome to this little folder that I'm creating to show 3 prototype designs of a coronary stent that was worked on by me for my project group.
Data and design parameters extracted from He et al., (2005) and Hara et al., (2006).

Design Parameters:
1) Longitudinal struts must kept to a minimum.
2) Gap sizes should be maximised to ensure no disturbed blood flow.
3) Corrugated/repeated designs tend to cause less vessel damage when implemented in balloon expanded stents.
4) Stent should have a diameter with a stent:artery ratio of around 1.2:1 to reduce the Wall Shear Stress of blood flow.
5) Thinner stent sizes tend to cause less simulated and in vivo ISR rates.
